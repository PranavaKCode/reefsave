            <h2>Who We Are & Mission</h2>
            <p>The mission of this non-profit is to research, educate, train and implement strategies to protect the reefs of the Western Atlantic and Caribbean Sea from loss of marine life from the Invasive Lionfish through practical implementations that create economic benefits for practices that promote long term reef health and are self-funding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>Background & Challenge</h2>
            <p>Reefs are not only the nursery for the oceans, but house a significant portion of all marine life and represent a substantial food source for the entire planet. A large portion of these reefs are located in underdeveloped countries that can neither afford economically or politically to prevent local uses that contribute to reef degradation.</p>
            <p>The Lionfish is Indo-pacific in origin but has no natural predators in the Caribbean or Atlantic. Its ferocious predation on juvenile species threatens to collapse the reef ecosystem. Traditional fishing methods do not work with Lionfish, and the most productive method currently (spearing via SCUBA) is only a stop-gap measure limited by depth.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Lionfish are highly venomous (though not poisonous to eat). This has led local populations to fear consuming them, despite Lionfish being a delicious flaky white fish. We must overcome this lack of knowledge and resources.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>Our Strategy</h2>
            <h3>1. Local People Receive Economic Benefit</h3>
            <p>Local people in affected regions must receive concrete benefits from changing destructive behavior. Only when they see direct economic gain will they adopt behaviors that benefit the reef.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Education Permits Political Will</h3>
            <p>Once local populations understand the impact and receive economic benefits, political obstructions to reef protection will be minimized.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Overcoming Lack of Resources</h3>
            <p>We provide the information, training, skills, and resources needed to change behaviors. We respect local customs and laws while providing a system adapted to specific regional needs.</p>

            <h2>Goals for the System Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reef education for participants and the community.</li>
                <li>Training needed to harvest using cutting-edge research.</li>
                <li>Resources needed to implement the model.</li>
                <li>Ownership for participants in their own small businesses.</li>
                <li>Creation of a market (e.g., Whole Foods) to assure purchases and economic success.</li>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>The Roadmap</h2>
            
            <h3>Phase 1: Testing Functionality (Completed)</h3>
            <p>The first step was to develop a trap that meets NOAA approval for commercial fishing below SCUBA limits. The <strong>No-Weld Lionfish Purse Trap</strong>, designed by Dr. Steven Gittings, has been proven effective with zero by-catch. ReefSave volunteers proved this could be built by hand in the field (Bequia 2019).</p>

            <h3>Phase 2: Location Prediction (In Process)</h3>
            <p>Traps work, but random deployment yields near-zero catch rates. ReefSave's 2018 testing showed that 40% of traps at 100+ feet had aggregation within 4 days <em>if the location was good</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Collect data about FAD (Fish Aggregation Device) aggregation rates to build a prediction model. We will analyze "Jaw Zone", "Near Zone", and "Far Zone" activity relative to temperature, depth, tide, and bottom type.</p>

            <h3>Phase 3: B-Corp Franchise (Planned)</h3>
            <p>We will establish a Benefit Corporation to franchise the system. Fishers will use a mobile app to receive GPS locations for traps. This ensures consistent supply, prevents poaching (buoys are submerged), and provides intellectual property that funds the non-profit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>2025-2026 Project Outline: Bequia</h2>
            <p><strong>Field Dates:</strong> August 17, 18, 19, 20, 2026.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Validate FAD aggregation prediction models without using full traps (to avoid permitting delays).</p>
            
            <h3>Data Collection Strategy</h3>
            <p>We will deploy underwater video cameras for 9-hour cycles over 4 days. We are capturing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zones:</strong> Jaw Zone (<6ft), Near Zone (6-10ft), Far Zone (>10ft).</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Temp, Depth, Slack Tide, Current Speed, Bottom Type.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Compass direction of entry/exit to identify food sources.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Volunteer Needs</h3>
            <p>We need SCUBA divers, Underwater Robot Operators, Line Handlers, and Data Managers. Training is provided in Miami. Robot operators will attempt to attach camera units to FAD frames to minimize SCUBA costs.</p>
